# Security Policy

## Minimal security posture
- Default bind is loopback (`127.0.0.1`).
- API key support is optional and simplistic; it is not a full authn/authz system.
- TLS termination is not built into Shoots.Host.

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you discover a security issue in Shoots.Host, please report it privately to the maintainers with:
- issue description
- reproduction steps
- impact assessment
